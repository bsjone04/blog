<div class="border"><p> A basic overview of Node JS as I understand it is a way to employ 'push' technology to create real time web applications over web sockets.
Ryan Dahl in the video shows examples of NodeJS' capabilities such as implementing code to a server without actually changing your core code. 
Dahl also shows examples of creating a web server in your command line that and explaining how it node is effective as long as it it non blocking code 
that may or may not be effective in the long run. Below are some advantages of NodeJS with Javascript as compared to standard Java.

<h3><u>Advantages of NodeJS</u></h3>
<li> Allows Javascript a place on the server and the browser</li>
<li> Allows you to easily and effectively switch between XML and Java.</li>
<li> You can easily and effectively mix NODE.js with CouchDB when working with Databases</li>
<li> No messing around with seperate threads when taking steps, this allows for lightning fast speed</li>
<br />
<br />
<h3><u>Disadvantages of NodeJS</u></h3>
<li>If one Node.Js request is slow, then everything slows down</li>
<li>Does not have as solid of a foundation of Java just yet but is getting there</li>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h3><u>Node has a Non-Blocking IO</u></h3>
<br />
<h4>How this is different then an Asynchronous IO:</h4>
<li>Allows for concurrent processing of multiple requests</li>
<li>Schedules a callback when the event has occured instead of waiting in a pending state</li>
<li>Can handle requests from thousands of open sockets with a single thread concurrently <br />
    by sequencing your js logic in a single stream of execution</li>
